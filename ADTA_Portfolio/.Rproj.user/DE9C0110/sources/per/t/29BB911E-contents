It is often useful to simulate random events for statistical applications. In this blog post, I will simulate rolling a pair of dice using R and creating some visualizations of the results. For this, I will use R's built in random number generator.

**Step 1: Simulating Dice Rolls**

```{r, echo=TRUE}
die <- 1:6
roll <- sample(die, 2, replace = TRUE)
```

**Step 2: Repeating the Simulation**

```{r, echo=TRUE}
n_simulations <- 10000
rolls <- numeric(n_simulations)

for (i in 1:n_simulations) {
  rolls[i] <- sum(sample(die, 2, replace = TRUE))
}
```

**Step 3: Creating Visualizations**

```{r, echo=TRUE}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(data.frame(rolls), aes(x = rolls)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, color = "black", fill = "white") +
  labs(x = "Sum of Dice Rolls", y = "Frequency")

ggplot(data.frame(rolls), aes(y = rolls)) + 
  geom_boxplot(color = "black", fill = "white") +
  labs(y = "Sum of Dice Rolls")
```

**I successfully simulated rolling a pair of dice using R, and created some visualizations of these results. This technique can be applied to many other random events in statistical applications.**

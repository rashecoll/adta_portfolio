    "text": "It is often useful to simulate random events for statistical applications. In this blog post, I will simulate rolling a pair of dice using R and creating some visualizations of the results. For this, I will use Râ€™s built in random number generator.\nStep 1: Simulating Dice Rolls\n\ndie <- 1:6\nroll <- sample(die, 2, replace = TRUE)\n\nStep 2: Repeating the Simulation\n\nn_simulations <- 10000\nrolls <- numeric(n_simulations)\n\nfor (i in 1:n_simulations) {\n  rolls[i] <- sum(sample(die, 2, replace = TRUE))\n}\n\nStep 3: Creating Visualizations\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nggplot(data.frame(rolls), aes(x = rolls)) + \n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, color = \"black\", fill = \"white\") +\n  labs(x = \"Sum of Dice Rolls\", y = \"Frequency\")\n\n\n\nggplot(data.frame(rolls), aes(y = rolls)) + \n  geom_boxplot(color = \"black\", fill = \"white\") +\n  labs(y = \"Sum of Dice Rolls\")\n\n\n\n\nI successfully simulated rolling a pair of dice using R, and created some visualizations of these results. This technique can be applied to many other random events in statistical applications."

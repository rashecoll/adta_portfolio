Welcome to my blog!

My name is Rashelle Collins, and I am currently pursuing my Master of Science in Advanced Data Analytics degree with a specialization in Health Data Science from the University of North Texas.

My passion for data analytics and its application in the field of healthcare led me to pursue this program. During my time at UNT, I have been fortunate to learn and develop proficiency in various tools and technologies used in the field of data analytics. These include statistics, probability, Microsoft Excel, SAS Enterprise Miner, Google Cloud Storage, Hadoop Distributed File System, Cloud SQL, Cloud Spanner, Big Query, Looker Studio, RapidMiner, OpenRefine, and R.
